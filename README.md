Completed automating test scripts for the key functionalities of the
Demo Web Shop website with the link mentioned in the Test URL. Created an
automation framework using Cypress and JavaScript to efficiently execute and validate test cases.
1. Set up a Cypress project with JavaScript using your preferred IDE. Implement Page Object Model
(POM) design pattern to organize your automation framework.
2. Develop automation to automate the identified test scenarios, including:
 Product browsing and searching.
 Adding items to the cart
 Checkout process up to the point where the user adds their billing address.
3. Enhance your automation scripts with appropriate assertions to validate the expected behavior
of the website.
4. Implement error handling and reporting mechanisms to capture and log any test failures.
Deliverable: Upload the above automation scripts into a repository platform and share the test scripts.
